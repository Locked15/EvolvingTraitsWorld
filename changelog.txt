v.2.0.0 - Negative Traits Rollout
General:
	- Asked Star to fix Sandbox Options mod, now it's working, enjoy changing your sandbox settings after game start (link in description)
	- Claustrophobic and Agoraphobic can be gained now. Existing progress is lost due splitting system into 2 different parts. New Sandbox Options included.
	- Outdoorsman can be lost now. Existing progress is lost due to system being rebuilt. New Sandbox Options included.
	- Pluviophobia can be gained now, Pluviophile can be lost now. Existing progress is saved but can be a bit weird since system was rescaled from 0% - 200% to -100% - 200%. New Sandbox Options included.
	- Asthmatic can be gained and lost now. Be aware that if you pick it on character creation, it's permanent. Sandbox options included.
	- Changed Sleep system due to impossible logic problems, now it's much simpler, and it's much easier to shift your schedule. I liked old system, but it wasn't working as intended.
	- Smoker is added and can be lost and earned. Sandbox options included.
	- Added ModOption to enable/disable notifications whenever you get the trait.
Moodles:
	- New sandbox options for Bloodlust and Sleep System moodles. Server admins can disable them for players by adjusting sandbox setting.
	- Smoker Moodle added. Shows how close you are from gaining or losing the trait. Sandbox options included.
Fixes:
	- Fixed traits showing their description twice.
	- Fixed missing initialization for fresh characters, so they get starting traits if they qualify for them.
Mod Conflicts:
	- Another shot at trying to resolve errors when ran with Superb Survivors.
	- Forage action shouldn't conflict with Snake modpack anymore.
Translations:
	- Italian translation added, courtesy of UattO
