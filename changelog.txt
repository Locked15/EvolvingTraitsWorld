v.1.2.0
General:
	- Mark Dynamic Traits submod is using much smarter logic, utilizing existing translations and just adding "(D)" at the end of the trait name, instead of using manually written translation files.
	- Removed ETW dependency from submod, meaning you can run submod without running main file.
	- Added support for SOTO to submod.
Moodles:
	- Added moodle for Sleep Schedule system, now you can see if you're sleeping in correct hours via the moodle, only active while sleeping.
	- Bloodlust Moodle is now shown only within 6 (customizable via sandbox) hours after killing a zombie
	- Bloodlust Moodle is now showing exact % how filled your Bloodlust Meter is.
	- New Sandbox Settings page, for moodle settings, at the moment it's quite empty, but new moodle settings will be there with time.
