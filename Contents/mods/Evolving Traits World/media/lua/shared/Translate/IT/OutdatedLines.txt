	Sandbox_EvolvingTraitsWorld_FearOfLocationsSystemCounter_tooltip = "Counter = amount of minutes you need to spend outside/inside to lose respective trait, Agoraphobic or Claustrophobic. Being outside/inside when stressed or unhappy will decrease counter. Reaching -counter value will GAIN you appropriate trait. Reaching +counter value will get rid of appropriate trait, being in between -counter and +counter will get you nothing. Lower boundary is -2x of counter, upper boundary is 2x of set value here.",
	Sandbox_EvolvingTraitsWorld_FearOfLocationsSystemCounterLoseMultiplier_tooltip = "How fast you decrease counter when you either unhappy (50%+) or stressed (50%+). Considering you're more often normal than unhappy or stressed, I'd recommend not setting this too low. Formula for how much counter decreases every minute is 1 * (1 + unhappiness(0-1)) + (1 * stress(0-1)) * multiplier, so at minimum you lose 0 * multiplier, at maximum you lose 4 * multiplier.",
